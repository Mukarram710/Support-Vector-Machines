# 🧠 Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Classification Task

Welcome to my machine learning project where I explored the power of **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** using both **Linear** and **RBF (Radial Basis Function)** kernels for binary classification tasks! 🚀

---

## 📌 Task Objective

- Train SVM classifiers on a real-world dataset.
- Understand and apply margin maximization and the kernel trick.
- Visualize decision boundaries for 2D data.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.

## 🔍 What I Did

✅ Loaded and preprocessed the Breast Cancer dataset  
✅ Applied feature scaling with `StandardScaler`  
✅ Trained SVM models using both Linear and RBF kernels  
✅ Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
✅ Tuned `C` and `gamma` using grid search with cross-validation  
✅ (Optional) Visualized decision boundaries on synthetic 2D data
